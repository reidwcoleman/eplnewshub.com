        <p class="lead">The Premier League title race has taken a dramatic turn as Arsenal surge clear at the summit while defending champions Liverpool endure their worst run in over 70 years. Here's everything you need to know from Matchweek 12 and the latest Champions League action.</p>

        <h2>Arsenal Extend Premier League Lead to Six Points</h2>

        <p>Mikel Arteta's Arsenal have established themselves as overwhelming favorites for the 2025-26 Premier League title after a remarkable week that saw them dismantle both Tottenham and Bayern Munich.</p>

        <h3>North London Derby: Eze Hat-Trick Stuns Spurs</h3>

        <p>Eberechi Eze scored one of the greatest hat-tricks in Arsenal history to win the north London derby and send the Gunners six points clear at the top of the table. The 4-1 demolition of Tottenham at the Emirates Stadium on November 23rd will go down as one of the most memorable derbies in recent history.</p>

        <p>Eze rubbed salt into Tottenham wounds as he produced three outstanding finishes after Leandro Trossard's opener. The England international came close to signing for Spurs in the summer before instead joining Arsenal — making his treble all the more painful for the visiting supporters.</p>

        <p>It was only the fourth ever hat-trick in competitive meetings between Arsenal and Spurs, after Ted Drake (1934), Terry Dyson (1961) and Alan Sunderland (1978).</p>

        <h3>Champions League: Arsenal Beat Bayern Munich 3-1</h3>

        <p>Just three days later, Arsenal maintained their perfect European record. Second-half goals from Noni Madueke and Gabriel Martinelli fired Arsenal to a 3-1 victory in the heavyweight Champions League clash with Bayern Munich. The win stretched Arsenal's perfect record in the competition to five victories from five matches.</p>

        <p>The Gunners go three points clear of second-placed Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League league phase table, with Bayern dropping to third.</p>

        <h2>Liverpool Crisis Deepens Under Arne Slot</h2>

        <p>The contrast between Arsenal's flying form and Liverpool's collapse couldn't be starker. The defending Premier League champions are in freefall.</p>

        <p>Arne Slot was facing a full-blown crisis at Liverpool after the beleaguered English champion lost by a three-goal margin for the third straight game and plunged into its worst run of form in more than 70 years. PSV Eindhoven pulled away for a 4-1 win at Anfield in the Champions League to leave Liverpool with nine defeats in its last 12 games.</p>

        <p>The last time Liverpool lost nine games in a 12-game streak in all competitions was in the 1953-54 season.</p>

        <p>The Reds were coming off 3-0 losses to Manchester City and Nottingham Forest before the PSV humiliation. Liverpool currently sit 12th in the Premier League table and 13th in the Champions League standings, with pressure growing on Slot to turn things around.</p>

        <p>Despite spending approximately $570 million in the summer transfer window on players like Alexander Isak and Florian Wirtz, Liverpool appear a shadow of the side that cruised to the title last season.</p>

        <h2>Manchester City Drop to Third After Newcastle Defeat</h2>

        <p>Pep Guardiola's title hopes took another hit as Manchester City fell to a 2-1 defeat at St James' Park.</p>

        <p>Harvey Barnes fired Newcastle to a welcome 2-1 Premier League victory over Manchester City with a quickfire double in a thrilling encounter at St James' Park. The former Leicester winger struck after 63 and 70 minutes either side of Ruben Dias' equaliser to secure a first league success against City for head coach Eddie Howe at the 19th attempt.</p>

        <p>The defeat, combined with Chelsea's earlier win against Burnley, saw the Blues move to second position in the league, with City dropping to third.</p>

        <p>City then suffered a 2-0 home defeat to Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League, with Guardiola admitting his rotation of 10 players was a mistake.</p>

        <h2>Match Preview: Chelsea vs Arsenal</h2>

        <p>Chelsea host Arsenal on Sunday, live on Sky Sports, as the Gunners' nearest challengers in the early Premier League standings. This will be the Blues' toughest examination yet.</p>

        <p>Arsenal haven't lost to Chelsea in their last 8 meetings (6 wins, 2 draws). However, Chelsea have won 5 of their last 6 matches in the Premier League and have kept a clean sheet in their last 3 matches.</p>

        <p>Arsenal will be without injured striker Viktor Gyökeres, but captain Martin Ødegaard has returned from injury and made a late substitute appearance against Bayern Munich.</p>

        <h2>Premier League Managerial Changes 2025-26</h2>

        <p>The second managerial departure came on 27 September 2025, when West Ham United sacked Graham Potter after a string of bad results. On the same day, Potter was replaced by Nuno Espírito Santo. The third managerial departure came on 18 October 2025, when Nottingham Forest sacked Ange Postecoglou after only 39 days in charge. Postecoglou was replaced by Sean Dyche on 21 October 2025. The fourth managerial departure came on 2 November 2025, when Wolverhampton Wanderers sacked Vítor Pereira following an extremely poor run of results.</p>

        <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

        <ul class="key-points">
            <li><strong>Arsenal are flying on all fronts</strong> — six points clear in the Premier League and top of the Champions League with a perfect record. Eberechi Eze's summer signing is looking like one of the deals of the decade.</li>
            <li><strong>Liverpool's title defence is effectively over.</strong> Arne Slot faces mounting pressure as the Reds sit 11 points behind Arsenal and have lost nine of their last 12 games across all competitions.</li>
            <li><strong>Chelsea have quietly emerged as Arsenal's closest challengers.</strong> Sunday's Stamford Bridge showdown will reveal whether Enzo Maresca's side can truly compete for the title.</li>
            <li><strong>Manchester City are struggling without their usual dominance,</strong> sitting third after four league defeats and facing questions about their squad depth.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="conclusion">Stay tuned for live coverage of Chelsea vs Arsenal this Sunday at 4:30 PM GMT — the biggest Premier League match of the season so far.</p>
