          <h2>Key Results from Matchweek 4: EPL Premier League Standings and Results</h2>

          <h3>Manchester United Triumph Over Southampton (3-0)</h3>
          <p>Manchester United bounced back from their recent loss to Liverpool with a 3-0 victory over Southampton at St. Mary’s. Goals from Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford helped secure the win. This result was crucial for United as they look to regain momentum early in the EPL Premier League season. Southampton, however, continued to struggle, failing to earn a single point so far this season.</p>

          <h3>Liverpool’s Stunning Defeat to Nottingham Forest (0-1)</h3>
          <p>Liverpool suffered a shocking 1-0 defeat at home to Nottingham Forest. Chris Wood’s goal secured all three points for Forest, who defended valiantly against Liverpool’s persistent attacks. This result marked Liverpool's first loss of the season and ended their perfect start. Despite dominating possession, Liverpool couldn't find the breakthrough and missed key chances, leaving manager Arne Slot frustrated.</p>

          <h3>Chelsea’s Late Win Against Bournemouth (1-0)</h3>
          <p>Chelsea secured a narrow 1-0 victory against Bournemouth thanks to a late goal from Christopher Nkunku. This was an important result for Chelsea, who have had a mixed start to their EPL Premier League campaign. Despite the win, Chelsea showed vulnerabilities, especially in controlling the tempo of the game. Bournemouth put up a strong defensive performance but lacked the attacking edge to capitalize on their opportunities.</p>

          <h3>Aston Villa Overcome Everton in a Five-Goal Thriller (3-2)</h3>
          <p>Aston Villa held off Everton in an exciting 3-2 win at Villa Park. Ollie Watkins played a key role, scoring twice to lead Villa to victory.

          <h3>Manchester City Maintain Perfect Start (2-1 vs Brentford)</h3>
          <p>Manchester City continued their unbeaten run with a 2-1 win over Brentford.

          <h3>Crystal Palace and Leicester Play Out a Thrilling Draw (2-2)</h3>
          <p>Crystal Palace and Leicester City played to a 2-2 draw in an entertaining EPL Premier League contest. Leicester’s Jamie Vardy opened the scoring, but Crystal Palace hit back through a brace from Jean-Philippe Mateta, who converted a late penalty to salvage a point.</p>

          <h3>Goalless Draw Between Brighton and Ipswich (0-0)</h3>
          <p>Brighton and Ipswich played out a 0-0 stalemate, with neither side able to break the deadlock. Despite Brighton dominating possession, they struggled to create clear-cut chances against a well-organized Ipswich defense in this EPL Premier League encounter.</p>

          <h3>Fulham Denied Victory by West Ham’s Last-Minute Equalizer (1-1)</h3>
          <p>Fulham were denied all three points by a stoppage-time goal from West Ham’s Danny Ings. Fulham had taken the lead through Raul Jimenez, but West Ham fought back to secure a point in dramatic fashion, ensuring they remained competitive in the EPL Premier League standings.</p>

          <h2>North London Derby: A Crucial Fixture for Arsenal and Tottenham in the EPL Premier League</h2>

Spurs are looking to capitalize on Arsenal’s injury woes and strengthen their position in the top four.

Federico Chiesa’s arrival at Liverpool from Juventus has been one of the most talked-about transfers. Although he didn’t feature in the defeat to Nottingham Forest, fans are eager to see him integrate into Liverpool’s forward line in the EPL Premier League.</p>

          <p>Manchester United’s acquisition of Manuel Ugarte from Paris Saint-Germain has also been highly anticipated. While Ugarte has yet to make his EPL Premier League debut, he is expected to play a significant role in strengthening United’s midfield. Meanwhile, Crystal Palace’s new center-back Maxence Lacroix made his debut in their draw against Leicester City and delivered a solid performance.</p>
