    <h2>What Is the Swiss Model?</h2>
          <p>The Swiss model is a league-style phase where all 36 teams are placed into a single table, but each team will play only <strong>eight matches</strong> against different opponents. These matchups are designed to ensure a mix of competitive levels, meaning teams will face a variety of challenges, rather than being grouped in a fixed bracket as in previous seasons.</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Each team plays four home and four away matches.</li>
              <li>The results from these eight games determine the teams' positions in the league table, with every match having significant importance.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Fans can look forward to seeing more high-stakes games between top clubs earlier in the competition. This ensures a more exciting viewing experience from Matchday 1, with top teams potentially facing each other much sooner than in the old group stage.</p>

          <h2>How Teams Qualify for the Knockouts</h2>
          <p>At the end of the league phase, teams qualify for the knockout rounds based on their position in the table:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Top 8 teams: Automatically qualify for the Round of 16.</li>
              <li>9th to 24th place: Enter a two-legged knockout play-off, with the winners advancing to the Round of 16.</li>
              <li>25th and below: These teams are eliminated from European competition, without dropping into the Europa League.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This format introduces an extra layer of pressure, as teams must secure points from the start to avoid being eliminated or forced into the play-offs.</p>

          <h2>New Opportunities for Teams</h2>
          <p>Under the new system, there are more opportunities for clubs from smaller leagues to compete. The addition of four more teams (36 instead of 32) allows for more representation from lower-ranked European leagues.</p>
          <ul>
              <li>The Champions Path remains a key route for domestic champions from smaller associations, giving them a chance to participate in the group stage.</li>
              <li>The two new places are awarded based on the best performing countries' club results from the previous season.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>For elite clubs, this format increases competition from the very beginning. There’s no room for complacency, as even top clubs may face strong opponents early in the league phase.</p>

          <h2>Key Benefits of the Swiss Model</h2>
          <ul>
              <li>More marquee matchups earlier in the competition, ensuring greater viewer engagement.</li>
              <li>Increased unpredictability, as teams from all tiers will face a variety of opponents, making each game critical for qualification.</li>
              <li>More high-stakes matches throughout the season, with every point and every goal mattering more than ever before.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Impact on Fans and Teams</h2>
          <p>For fans, the new format delivers a more exciting and competitive tournament, as top clubs will no longer cruise through a predictable group stage. Every game matters, and even historically strong teams may find themselves fighting for points against unexpected challengers.</p>
          <p>For mid-tier and smaller clubs, this format presents more chances to advance deeper into the competition. The play-off round provides another opportunity to reach the knockout stage, and the random draw means any team could face a favorable matchup early on.</p>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>The UEFA Champions League’s switch to the Swiss model for the 2024/25 season is a bold move aimed at increasing competition and excitement. By introducing more games, more unpredictability, and a higher level of competition throughout the league phase, the new format promises to keep both fans and teams on the edge of their seats from start to finish.</p>
