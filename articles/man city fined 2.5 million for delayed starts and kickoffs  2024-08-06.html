            <h1>Manchester City Fined for Multiple Delayed Kickoffs and Restarts</h1>
            <p>In a recent development, Manchester City has been hit with a substantial fine exceeding £2 million (approximately $2.56 million) by the Premier League for multiple instances of delayed kickoffs and restarts over the past two seasons. The reigning champions were found guilty of breaching Premier League Rule L.33, which mandates timely kickoffs and restarts to maintain the league's professional standards and ensure a consistent broadcast schedule worldwide.</p>

            <h2>The Incidents and Fines</h2>
            <p>The Premier League's investigation revealed that Manchester City delayed kickoffs or restarts on 22 occasions across the 2022-23 and 2023-24 seasons. The infractions began with a minor delay of one minute and 18 seconds against Crystal Palace in August 2022, which resulted in an initial warning. Subsequent delays, however, led to increasingly significant fines, with the largest single fine being £200,000 for a delay of two minutes and 46 seconds at the start of their final game of the 2023-24 season against West Ham United&#8203;:citation[oaicite:5]{index=5}&#8203;&#8203;:citation[oaicite:4]{index=4}&#8203;.</p>

            <h2>Breakdown of the Fines</h2>
            <p>The fines were structured on a sliding scale based on the duration and frequency of the delays:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>2022-23 Season:</b> Manchester City faced eight delays, culminating in fines totaling £390,000.</li>
                <li><b>2023-24 Season:</b> The club committed 14 delays, with fines amounting to £1.7 million. This included 11 delays in the second half and four at the beginning of matches&#8203;:citation[oaicite:3]{index=3}&#8203;.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Premier League's Statement</h2>
