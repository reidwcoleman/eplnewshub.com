        <div class="article-body">
            <p class="lead">Manchester City's 2025-26 campaign marks a sharp departure from the club's dominance in English and European football over the last decade. Under Pep Guardiola, City had established themselves as an almost unstoppable force, clinching six Premier League titles since 2016. However, this season has unveiled uncharacteristic struggles, signaling a period of transition and rebuilding for the Cityzens.</p>

            <h2>The Rodri Effect: City's Missing Heartbeat</h2>

            <p>One of the major reasons behind Manchester City's decline this season is the injury absence of midfield cornerstone Rodri. His ability to control the tempo, break up opposition attacks, and provide a reliable pivot shielded City's defense and facilitated their high-possession style. The team's susceptibility to quick counter-attacks increased dramatically without him, exposing tactical vulnerabilities in their defensive transitions.</p>

            <h2>Departures of Club Icons</h2>

            <p>Another challenge has been the departure of long-time club icons Kevin De Bruyne, Kyle Walker, and Ederson during the offseason. The loss of De Bruyne's creative genius and Walker's defensive experience has impacted both the midfield dynamics and defensive solidity. Though new signings such as Gianluigi Donnarumma and promising youngsters like Tijjani Reijnders have stepped in, the team still faces a period of adjustment to regain its prior chemistry and strength.</p>

            <h2>Tactical Vulnerabilities Exposed</h2>

            <p>Tactically, City continue to rely on dominating possession and pressing opponents; however, increased off-ball disorganization and lapses in counter-pressing have led to more defensive errors. Opponents have capitalized on these openings, particularly exploiting City's high defensive lines with rapid counter-attacks. For the first time in Guardiola's tenure, Manchester City recorded the lowest points-per-game ratio, and their defensive fragility was apparent in every major competition they entered last season.</p>

            <h2>Haaland's Brilliance Amid Team Struggles</h2>

            <p>Erling Haaland's goal-scoring form remains a rare bright spot, demonstrating his continued elite quality despite the team's broader issues. Yet, the squad as a whole has struggled to consistently convert possession into results. Early season defeats against Tottenham and Brighton heightened concerns about their form and potential to compete for titles.</p>

            <h2>Guardiola's Rebuilding Mission</h2>

            <p>Pep Guardiola has acknowledged the tough phase and frames this season as one of "unfinished business." He's expressed optimism about recent improvements and the contributions of new recruits, insisting that better collective performance is on the horizon. The club is focused on reestablishing itself among the top contenders by reinforcing defensive organization, maintaining attacking potency, and rebuilding the mental resilience synonymous with their past success.</p>

            <h2>Testing Schedule Ahead</h2>

            <p>The season schedule tests Manchester City heavily, featuring multiple encounters with traditional big-six rivals such as Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea, and Manchester United. Success in these high-profile fixtures will be crucial for City's ambitions to return to the summit of the Premier League and make a strong impact in the UEFA Champions League.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>

            <p>In summary, Manchester City's 2025-26 struggles stem from a mixture of crucial player absences, tactical gaps in defensive transitions, and ongoing squad rebuild challenges. While the team is not yet performing at its usual world-class level, signs of recovery and renewed focus suggest that the club's ambitions are far from diminished. How quickly Guardiola's side can reclaim their dominance remains a compelling storyline as the season unfolds.</p>
