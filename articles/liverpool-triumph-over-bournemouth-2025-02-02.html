          <p>The first goal came from a penalty awarded after Cody Gakpo was fouled by Lewis Cook. The Premier League later clarified that VAR upheld the referee's decision, confirming that Cook's challenge was a trip and that Gakpo was onside. Despite this clarification, the decision has been divisive among fans and pundits alike.</p>
          <p>Reflecting on the match, Liverpool's head coach Arne Slot commented, "It was a hard-fought game. Bournemouth put up a strong fight, but our players showed resilience and determination to secure the win."</p>

          <p>Bournemouth's manager, Andoni Iraola, expressed his frustration with the penalty decision, stating, "I believe the penalty was harsh. Such decisions can change the course of the game, and today it went against us."</p>
          <p>This victory not only solidifies Liverpool's position at the top of the table but also highlights the ongoing debates surrounding VAR decisions in the Premier League.</p>
