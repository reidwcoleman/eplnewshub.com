    <h2>The Turning Point: Nuno Espírito Santo’s Vision</h2>
            <p>Appointed in December 2023, Nuno Espírito Santo has been instrumental in transforming Nottingham Forest. Known for his pragmatic yet innovative approach, Nuno inherited a squad teetering near the relegation zone. Within a year, he has not only stabilized the team but also turned them into genuine contenders for European football. His ability to implement a structured defensive system while allowing creative freedom up front has been key to their success.</p>

            <blockquote>"Every player has a role, every movement has a purpose," Nuno said in a recent interview.</blockquote>
