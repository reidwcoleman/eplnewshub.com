Fans searching for "why was Eberechi Eze free kick disallowed" or "Eze goal disallowed Chelsea" are often left puzzled by the intricacies of modern football rules. This article dives deep into the controversy surrounding Eze's stunning strike during the Crystal Palace vs Chelsea match, explaining the VAR intervention, the specific rule violated, and the broader implications for the game.</p>

                <h2>The Incident: Eberechi Eze's Thunderous Free-Kick Moment</h2>
                <p>The match between Chelsea and Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge was a tense affair in the 2024-2025 Premier League season. Crystal Palace, under manager Oliver Glasner, were pushing for an equalizer when they won a free-kick just outside the Chelsea penalty area. Eberechi Eze, the talented England international known for his set-piece expertise, stepped up to take it.</p>
                
                <p>Eze's delivery was nothing short of brilliant—a curling rocket that soared past Chelsea goalkeeper Robert Sanchez and into the top corner. Palace fans erupted, and it seemed like a pivotal moment in the game. However, celebrations were cut short as referee Darren England was called to the pitchside monitor by VAR officials.</p>
                
                <div class="highlight-stat">
                    <strong>Key Point:</strong> The issue wasn't with the strike itself—it was an infringement spotted by VAR involving Palace defender Marc Guehi.

                <h2>VAR Decision: Why Eze's Goal Was Ruled Out Against Chelsea</h2>
                <p>The key to understanding why Eberechi Eze's goal was disallowed lies in the VAR review process. Initially, referee Darren England awarded the goal, but VAR flagged a potential foul play. Upon checking the monitor, England announced: "After review, away number six encroached within one metre of the wall." This referred to Marc Guehi (wearing number six for Palace), who was positioned too close to Chelsea's defensive wall.</p>
                
                <p>Video evidence revealed Guehi not only breaching the one-metre distance but also making contact with Chelsea's Moises Caicedo, disrupting the wall's formation. This encroachment gave Palace an unfair advantage, leading to the disallowance. For those querying "Eze VAR decision Chelsea," this call exemplifies how technology enforces rules that might escape the naked eye, turning what could have been a game-changer into a retaken free-kick.</p>

                <h2>The Rule Explained: Law 13 and Encroachment in Free-Kicks</h2>
                <p>At the heart of the "why was Eze's free kick disallowed" debate is IFAB's Law 13, which governs free-kicks in football. Introduced in the 2019-2020 season, this rule states that when a defending team forms a wall of three or more players, attacking players must remain at least one metre (about 1.09 yards) away from that wall until the ball is in play.</p>
                
                <div class="rules-breakdown">
                    <h3>Step-by-Step Breakdown of the Rule Application:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Defensive Wall Formation:</strong> Chelsea set up a wall to block Eze's shot</li>
                        <li><strong>Attacking Player Distance:</strong> Players like Guehi must stay one metre back to avoid interference</li>
                        <li><strong>Infringement Detection:</strong> Guehi was within the restricted zone and pushed Caicedo, violating the rule</li>
                        <li><strong>Consequence:</strong> The free-kick is retaken, and the goal is nullified if scored</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                
                <p>This "little-known rule" has caught many off guard, but it's designed to prevent jostling and promote fair play. Searches for "Marc Guehi encroachment Eze free kick" highlight how this specific violation was the deciding factor, not offside or handball as some initially assumed.</p>

                <h2>Fan and Pundit Reactions to Eze's Disallowed Free-Kick</h2>
                <p>The disallowance ignited a firestorm online, with "Eze goal disallowed controversy" trending across social media. Crystal Palace supporters decried VAR for "killing football," arguing the encroachment had minimal impact. One viral tweet read: "Eberechi Eze's free-kick was pure magic—why disallow it over a technicality?" Chelsea fans, conversely, praised the decision for upholding the rules.</p>
                
                <p>Pundits from outlets like Sky Sports and The Sun weighed in, noting how VAR "bailed out" Sanchez from a potential howler. Eze himself remained diplomatic post-match, while Glasner expressed frustration, questioning the rule's enforcement. This reaction underscores broader debates about VAR in the Premier League, with calls for clearer guidelines on set-piece encroachments.</p>
