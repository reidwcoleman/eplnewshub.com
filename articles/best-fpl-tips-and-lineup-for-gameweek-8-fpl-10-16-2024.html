          <h1>Top FPL Picks for Gameweek 8</h1>
          <p>As we head into <strong>Fantasy Premier League (FPL) Gameweek 8</strong>, it’s crucial to build a team that capitalizes on favorable matchups. Here are the top picks for each position:</p>

          <h2>Goalkeepers</h2>
          <p><strong>Nick Pope (Newcastle, £5.5m):</strong> Newcastle faces Bournemouth, a team struggling in attack, making Pope a great option for clean sheet points.</p>

          <h2>Defenders</h2>
          <p><strong>Kieran Trippier (Newcastle, £6.7m):</strong> His attacking returns, combined with a potential clean sheet against Bournemouth, make Trippier a must-have.</p>
          <p><strong>Pedro Porro (Tottenham, £5.0m):</strong> Facing Luton, Porro offers both defensive and attacking returns in this favorable fixture.</p>

          <h2>Midfielders</h2>
          <p><strong>Mohamed Salah (Liverpool, £12.6m):</strong> Salah is in excellent form and faces a Brighton side that has struggled defensively, making him a strong captaincy option.</p>
          <p><strong>Son Heung-min (Tottenham, £9.3m):</strong> Playing centrally, Son has flourished, and against Luton, he’s expected to deliver big points.</p>

          <h2>Forwards</h2>
          <p><strong>Erling Haaland (Man City, £14.1m):</strong> Despite a tough fixture against Arsenal, Haaland’s goal-scoring ability makes him hard to ignore.</p>
          <p><strong>Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa, £8.0m):</strong> Watkins is in fine form and faces Wolves, a team vulnerable at the back, making him a top pick this week.</p>

          <h2>Differential Picks</h2>
          <p><strong>Raheem Sterling (Chelsea, £7.2m):</strong> Against Burnley, Sterling’s pace and creativity could bring returns for those looking for a low-ownership player.</p>
          <p><strong>Pedro Neto (Wolves, £5.7m):</strong> Neto has been consistent with assists and could perform well against Aston Villa.</p>

          <h2>Captaincy Choices</h2>
          <ol>
              <li><strong>Son Heung-min:</strong> With Luton’s weak defense, Son is a standout captain pick.</li>
              <li><strong>Mohamed Salah:</strong> Brighton’s leaky defense makes Salah a strong contender for the armband.</li>
              <li><strong>Erling Haaland:</strong> Despite the Arsenal fixture, Haaland’s ownership and goal potential cannot be overlooked.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>For Gameweek 8, focus on Tottenham assets like Son and Maddison due to their favorable fixture against Luton. Salah and Haaland remain essential, while differentials like Sterling offer great upside. Plan your captaincy carefully to maximize points this week.</p>
