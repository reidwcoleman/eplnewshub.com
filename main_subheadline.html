</a>
<p>Manchester City faces a significant challenge following the announcement that their key midfielder, Rodri, will miss the rest of the 2024/25 season due to a serious anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Rodri has been a mainstay in City’s midfield since joining the club in 2019, acting as the team’s defensive anchor, shielding the backline, and playing a crucial role in Guardiola’s build-up play. His absence raises critical questions about how City will adjust tactically and which players might step in to fill the void.</p>
