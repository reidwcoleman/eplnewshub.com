Among these, the new 8-second goalkeeper rule has already made headlines, with Burnley's Martin Dubravka becoming the first victim during their opening match against Tottenham Hotspur on August 16, 2025. This groundbreaking change, aimed at clamping down on deliberate delays, marks a significant shift in how goalkeepers operate in the English top flight. In this in-depth article, we'll explore the details of the Premier League 8-second rule, the Dubravka incident, reactions from the football community, and its potential long-term impact on the beautiful game.\nWhat is the New 8-Second Goalkeeper Rule in the Premier League?\nFor years, goalkeepers have been limited to holding the ball for six seconds before facing an indirect free kick inside their penalty area. However, enforcement was inconsistent, and the penalty often proved ineffective. Enter the updated Law 12 from the International Football Association Board (IFAB): Goalkeepers now have eight seconds to release the ball once they gain control inside their penalty area. The clock starts when the keeper has clear possession and the ability to distribute—such as after a save or back-pass.\nTo ensure transparency and fairness, referees provide a visible countdown: They raise their arm when five seconds remain, giving the goalkeeper a clear warning. If the ball isn't released within the full eight seconds (via a throw, kick, or drop to feet), the opposing team is awarded a corner kick—a much harsher and more attacking-oriented penalty than the previous indirect free kick.\nThis Premier League 8-second goalkeeper rule was trialed in competitions like the UEFA Under-21 European Championship and the FIFA Club World Cup earlier in 2025, where it successfully reduced time-wasting without disrupting the flow of matches. The change is part of a broader IFAB initiative to make football faster and more entertaining, addressing fan frustrations over games dragging in the final minutes.\nKey Differences from the Old 6-Second Rule\nTo better understand the evolution, here's a quick comparison:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAspectOld 6-Second RuleNew 8-Second RuleTime Limit6 seconds8 secondsPenaltyIndirect free kick in penalty areaCorner kick to oppositionCountdown MechanismVerbal or no warningVisible arm raise at 5 secondsEnforcement FocusOften lenientStricter, with visual cues\nThis table highlights how the new rule incentivizes quicker play, potentially leading to more goals from set pieces.\nThe Incident: Martin Dubravka's Costly Delay in Burnley vs Tottenham\nOn the opening day of the 2025/26 Premier League season at Turf Moor, Slovakian goalkeeper Martin Dubravka—recently transferred from Newcastle United to Burnley—made unwanted history. In the 62nd minute of Burnley's clash with Tottenham Hotspur, Dubravka collected the ball after a routine save from a Spurs attack. As he scanned for options, the referee initiated the five-second countdown by raising his arm.\nDubravka hesitated, perhaps due to limited passing lanes or the pressure of his debut, and exceeded the eight-second limit. The whistle blew, and Tottenham was awarded a corner kick—the first such penalty under the new rule in Premier League history. Although the corner didn't result in a goal, it ramped up the intensity for Burnley, who were already trailing 2-0 at the time. Spurs went on to win 3-0, but the moment stole the spotlight in post-match discussions.\nDubravka, a 36-year-old veteran with extensive Premier League experience, later admitted the adjustment would take time: \"It's a new rule, and in the heat of the moment, those seconds fly by. I'll learn from it.\" Burnley manager Scott Parker supported his keeper, calling for referees to apply the rule consistently throughout the season.\nHistory and Reasons Behind the Premier League 8-Second Rule Introduction\nTime-wasting by goalkeepers has been a thorn in football's side since the 1990s, when the original six-second rule was introduced to curb excessive delays. However, data from recent seasons showed keepers often held the ball for 10-15 seconds without punishment, frustrating opponents and spectators.\nIFAB's decision to extend to eight seconds while toughening the penalty stems from successful trials. For instance, in the 2024/25 Club World Cup, the rule led to a 20% reduction in stoppage time added for delays. Premier League officials, including chief refereeing officer Howard Webb, emphasized that the change promotes \"fair play and excitement,\" aligning with fan demands for more action-packed matches.\nReactions from Players, Managers, and Fans to the 8-Second Goalkeeper Violation\nThe Dubravka incident ignited a firestorm of opinions across social media and punditry circles. Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou praised the rule, saying it \"adds urgency and prevents games from fizzling out.\" On the other hand, some keepers like Manchester City's Ederson voiced concerns: \"Eight seconds might not be enough in crowded boxes— it could lead to rushed mistakes.\"\nFans on platforms like Reddit debated its fairness, with one user noting, \"The 8-second rule will be enforced strictly at first, then forgotten until it costs someone a title.\" Overall, supporters seem divided: 60% in a BBC Sport poll approved of the change for reducing boredom, while 40% worried about over-officiating.\nPotential Implications and Future of the Premier League 8-Second Rule\nThis new regulation could revolutionize goalkeeping tactics. Teams may train keepers to distribute faster, favoring those with strong footwork like Liverpool's Alisson or Arsenal's David Raya. Analysts predict an increase in corners conceded—potentially 5-10 per team per season—leading to more scoring opportunities.\nHowever, challenges remain: Will referees enforce it uniformly? Could it disadvantage smaller clubs with less technical keepers? As the season unfolds, expect more 8-second violations, but also adaptations that make the Premier League even more thrilling.\nIn related news, the 2025/26 season features other changes like stricter offside calls and captain-only referee interactions, all aimed at modernizing the league. For goalkeepers, the message is clear: Time is no longer on your side.\nStay tuned for more updates on Premier League rule changes and their on-pitch effects.

changes designed to speed up play and reduce time-wasting.</strong> Among these, the new 8-second goalkeeper rule has already made headlines, with Burnley's Martin Dubravka becoming the first victim during their opening match against Tottenham Hotspur on August 16, 2025.</p>\n                \n                <p>This groundbreaking change, aimed at clamping down on deliberate delays, marks a significant shift in how goalkeepers operate in the English top flight. In this in-depth article, we'll explore the details of the Premier League 8-second rule, the Dubravka incident, reactions from the football community, and its potential long-term impact on the beautiful game.</p>\n                \n                <h2>What is the New 8-Second Goalkeeper Rule in the Premier League?</h2>\n                \n                <p>For years, goalkeepers have been limited to holding the ball for six seconds before facing an indirect free kick inside their penalty area. However, enforcement was inconsistent, and the penalty often proved ineffective. Enter the updated Law 12 from the International Football Association Board (IFAB):</p>\n                \n                <div class=\"key-points\">\n                    <h3>Key Rule Changes:</h3>\n                    <ul>\n                        <li>Goalkeepers now have <strong>eight seconds</strong> to release the ball once they gain control inside their penalty area</li>\n                        <li>The clock starts when the keeper has clear possession and the ability to distribute—such as after a save or back-pass</li>\n                        <li>Referees provide a visible countdown by raising their arm when five seconds remain, giving the goalkeeper a clear warning</li>\n                        <li>If the ball isn't released within the full eight seconds (via a throw, kick, or drop to feet), the opposing team is awarded a <strong>corner kick</strong>—a much harsher and more attacking-oriented penalty than the previous indirect free kick</li>\n                    </ul>\n                </div>\n                \n                <p>This Premier League 8-second goalkeeper rule was trialed in competitions like the UEFA Under-21 European Championship and the FIFA Club World Cup earlier in 2025, where it successfully reduced time-wasting without disrupting the flow of matches. The change is part of a broader IFAB initiative to make football faster and more entertaining, addressing fan frustrations over games dragging in the final minutes.</p>\n                \n                <h2>Key Differences from the Old 6-Second Rule</h2>\n                \n                <p>To better understand the evolution, here's a quick comparison:</p>\n                \n                <table class=\"comparison-table\">\n                    <thead>\n                        <tr>\n                            <th>Aspect</th>\n                            <th>Old 6-Second Rule</th>\n                            <th>New 8-Second Rule</th>\n                        </tr>\n                    </thead>\n                    <tbody>\n                        <tr>\n                            <td><strong>Time Limit</strong></td>\n                            <td>6 seconds</td>\n                            <td>8 seconds</td>\n                        </tr>\n                        <tr>\n                            <td><strong>Penalty</strong></td>\n                            <td>Indirect free kick in penalty area</td>\n                            <td>Corner kick to opposition</td>\n                        </tr>\n                        <tr>\n                            <td><strong>Countdown Mechanism</strong></td>\n                            <td>Verbal or no warning</td>\n                            <td>Visible arm raise at 5 seconds</td>\n                        </tr>\n                        <tr>\n                            <td><strong>Enforcement Focus</strong></td>\n                            <td>Often lenient</td>\n                            <td>Stricter, with visual cues</td>\n                        </tr>\n                    </tbody>\n                </table>\n                \n                <p>This table highlights how the new rule incentivizes quicker play, potentially leading to more goals from set pieces.</p>\n                \n                <h2>The Incident: Martin Dubravka's Costly Delay in Burnley vs Tottenham</h2>\n                \n                <p>On the opening day of the 2025/26 Premier League season at Turf Moor, Slovakian goalkeeper Martin Dubravka—recently transferred from Newcastle United to Burnley—made unwanted history. In the 62nd minute of Burnley's clash with Tottenham Hotspur, Dubravka collected the ball after a routine save from a Spurs attack. As he scanned for options, the referee initiated the five-second countdown by raising his arm.</p>\n                \n                <p>Dubravka hesitated, perhaps due to limited passing lanes or the pressure of his debut, and exceeded the eight-second limit. The whistle blew, and Tottenham was awarded a corner kick—the first such penalty under the new rule in Premier League history. Although the corner didn't result in a goal, it ramped up the intensity for Burnley, who were already trailing 2-0 at the time. Spurs went on to win 3-0, but the moment stole the spotlight in post-match discussions.</p>\n                \n                <div class=\"quote-box\">\n                    <p>\"It's a new rule, and in the heat of the moment, those seconds fly by.

Burnley manager Scott Parker supported his keeper, calling for referees to apply the rule consistently throughout the season.</p>\n                \n                <h2>History and Reasons Behind the Premier League 8-Second Rule Introduction</h2>\n                \n                <p>Time-wasting by goalkeepers has been a thorn in football's side since the 1990s, when the original six-second rule was introduced to curb excessive delays. However, data from recent seasons showed keepers often held the ball for 10-15 seconds without punishment, frustrating opponents and spectators.</p>\n                \n                <p>IFAB's decision to extend to eight seconds while toughening the penalty stems from successful trials. For instance, in the 2024/25 Club World Cup, the rule led to a <strong>20% reduction in stoppage time</strong> added for delays. Premier League officials, including chief refereeing officer Howard Webb, emphasized that the change promotes \"fair play and excitement,\" aligning with fan demands for more action-packed matches.</p>\n                \n                <h2>Reactions from Players, Managers, and Fans to the 8-Second Goalkeeper Violation</h2>\n                \n                <p>The Dubravka incident ignited a firestorm of opinions across social media and punditry circles. Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou praised the rule, saying it \"adds urgency and prevents games from fizzling out.\" On the other hand, some keepers like Manchester City's Ederson voiced concerns: \"Eight seconds might not be enough in crowded boxes—it could lead to rushed mistakes.\"</p>\n                \n                <p>Fans on platforms like Reddit debated its fairness, with one user noting, \"The 8-second rule will be enforced strictly at first, then forgotten until it costs someone a title.\" Overall, supporters seem divided:</p>\n                \n                <ul>\n                    <li><strong>60%</strong> in a BBC Sport poll approved of the change for reducing boredom</li>\n                    <li><strong>40%</strong> worried about over-officiating</li>\n                </ul>\n                \n                <h2>Potential Implications and Future of the Premier League 8-Second Rule</h2>\n                \n                <p>This new regulation could revolutionize goalkeeping tactics. Teams may train keepers to distribute faster, favoring those with strong footwork like Liverpool's Alisson or Arsenal's David Raya. Analysts predict an increase in corners conceded—potentially 5-10 per team per season—leading to more scoring opportunities.</p>\n                \n                <p>However, challenges remain:</p>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>Will referees enforce it uniformly?</li>\n                    <li>Could it disadvantage smaller clubs with less technical keepers?</li>\n                    <li>How will teams adapt their defensive strategies?</li>\n                </ul>\n                \n                <p>As the season unfolds, expect more 8-second violations, but also adaptations that make the Premier League even more thrilling.</p>\n                \n                <p>In related news, the 2025/26 season features other changes like stricter offside calls and captain-only referee interactions, all aimed at modernizing the league.

changes designed to speed up play and reduce time-wasting.</strong> Among these, the new 8-second goalkeeper rule has already made headlines, with Burnley's Martin Dubravka becoming the first victim during their opening match against Tottenham Hotspur on August 16, 2025.</p>\n                \n                <p>This groundbreaking change, aimed at clamping down on deliberate delays, marks a significant shift in how goalkeepers operate in the English top flight. In this in-depth article, we'll explore the details of the Premier League 8-second rule, the Dubravka incident, reactions from the football community, and its potential long-term impact on the beautiful game.</p>\n                \n                <h2>What is the New 8-Second Goalkeeper Rule in the Premier League?</h2>\n                \n                <p>For years, goalkeepers have been limited to holding the ball for six seconds before facing an indirect free kick inside their penalty area. However, enforcement was inconsistent, and the penalty often proved ineffective. Enter the updated Law 12 from the International Football Association Board (IFAB):</p>\n                \n                <div class=\"key-points\">\n                    <h3>Key Rule Changes:</h3>\n                    <ul>\n                        <li>Goalkeepers now have <strong>eight seconds</strong> to release the ball once they gain control inside their penalty area</li>\n                        <li>The clock starts when the keeper has clear possession and the ability to distribute—such as after a save or back-pass</li>\n                        <li>Referees provide a visible countdown by raising their arm when five seconds remain, giving the goalkeeper a clear warning</li>\n                        <li>If the ball isn't released within the full eight seconds (via a throw, kick, or drop to feet), the opposing team is awarded a <strong>corner kick</strong>—a much harsher and more attacking-oriented penalty than the previous indirect free kick</li>\n                    </ul>\n                </div>\n                \n                <p>This Premier League 8-second goalkeeper rule was trialed in competitions like the UEFA Under-21 European Championship and the FIFA Club World Cup earlier in 2025, where it successfully reduced time-wasting without disrupting the flow of matches. The change is part of a broader IFAB initiative to make football faster and more entertaining, addressing fan frustrations over games dragging in the final minutes.</p>\n                \n                <h2>Key Differences from the Old 6-Second Rule</h2>\n                \n                <p>To better understand the evolution, here's a quick comparison:</p>\n                \n                <table class=\"comparison-table\">\n                    <thead>\n                        <tr>\n                            <th>Aspect</th>\n                            <th>Old 6-Second Rule</th>\n                            <th>New 8-Second Rule</th>\n                        </tr>\n                    </thead>\n                    <tbody>\n                        <tr>\n                            <td><strong>Time Limit</strong></td>\n                            <td>6 seconds</td>\n                            <td>8 seconds</td>\n                        </tr>\n                        <tr>\n                            <td><strong>Penalty</strong></td>\n                            <td>Indirect free kick in penalty area</td>\n                            <td>Corner kick to opposition</td>\n                        </tr>\n                        <tr>\n                            <td><strong>Countdown Mechanism</strong></td>\n                            <td>Verbal or no warning</td>\n                            <td>Visible arm raise at 5 seconds</td>\n                        </tr>\n                        <tr>\n                            <td><strong>Enforcement Focus</strong></td>\n                            <td>Often lenient</td>\n                            <td>Stricter, with visual cues</td>\n                        </tr>\n                    </tbody>\n                </table>\n                \n                <p>This table highlights how the new rule incentivizes quicker play, potentially leading to more goals from set pieces.</p>\n                \n                <h2>The Incident: Martin Dubravka's Costly Delay in Burnley vs Tottenham</h2>\n                \n                <p>On the opening day of the 2025/26 Premier League season at Turf Moor, Slovakian goalkeeper Martin Dubravka—recently transferred from Newcastle United to Burnley—made unwanted history. In the 62nd minute of Burnley's clash with Tottenham Hotspur, Dubravka collected the ball after a routine save from a Spurs attack. As he scanned for options, the referee initiated the five-second countdown by raising his arm.</p>\n                \n                <p>Dubravka hesitated, perhaps due to limited passing lanes or the pressure of his debut, and exceeded the eight-second limit. The whistle blew, and Tottenham was awarded a corner kick—the first such penalty under the new rule in Premier League history. Although the corner didn't result in a goal, it ramped up the intensity for Burnley, who were already trailing 2-0 at the time. Spurs went on to win 3-0, but the moment stole the spotlight in post-match discussions.</p>\n                \n                <div class=\"quote-box\">\n                    <p>\"It's a new rule, and in the heat of the moment, those seconds fly by. I'll learn from it.\" - Martin Dubravka, post-match interview</p>\n                </div>\n                \n                <p>Dubravka, a 36-year-old veteran with extensive Premier League experience, later admitted the adjustment would take time. Burnley manager Scott Parker supported his keeper, calling for referees to apply the rule consistently throughout the season.</p>\n                \n                <h2>History and Reasons Behind the Premier League 8-Second Rule Introduction</h2>\n                \n                <p>Time-wasting by goalkeepers has been a thorn in football's side since the 1990s, when the original six-second rule was introduced to curb excessive delays. However, data from recent seasons showed keepers often held the ball for 10-15 seconds without punishment, frustrating opponents and spectators.</p>\n                \n                <p>IFAB's decision to extend to eight seconds while toughening the penalty stems from successful trials. For instance, in the 2024/25 Club World Cup, the rule led to a <strong>20% reduction in stoppage time</strong> added for delays. Premier League officials, including chief refereeing officer Howard Webb, emphasized that the change promotes \"fair play and excitement,\" aligning with fan demands for more action-packed matches.</p>\n                \n                <h2>Reactions from Players, Managers, and Fans to the 8-Second Goalkeeper Violation</h2>\n                \n                <p>The Dubravka incident ignited a firestorm of opinions across social media and punditry circles. Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou praised the rule, saying it \"adds urgency and prevents games from fizzling out.\" On the other hand, some keepers like Manchester City's Ederson voiced concerns: \"Eight seconds might not be enough in crowded boxes—it could lead to rushed mistakes.\"</p>\n                \n                <p>Fans on platforms like Reddit debated its fairness, with one user noting, \"The 8-second rule will be enforced strictly at first, then forgotten until it costs someone a title.\" Overall, supporters seem divided:</p>\n                \n                <ul>\n                    <li><strong>60%</strong> in a BBC Sport poll approved of the change for reducing boredom</li>\n                    <li><strong>40%</strong> worried about over-officiating</li>\n                </ul>\n                \n                <h2>Potential Implications and Future of the Premier League 8-Second Rule</h2>\n                \n                <p>This new regulation could revolutionize goalkeeping tactics. Teams may train keepers to distribute faster, favoring those with strong footwork like Liverpool's Alisson or Arsenal's David Raya. Analysts predict an increase in corners conceded—potentially 5-10 per team per season—leading to more scoring opportunities.</p>\n                \n                <p>However, challenges remain:</p>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>Will referees enforce it uniformly?</li>\n                    <li>Could it disadvantage smaller clubs with less technical keepers?</li>\n                    <li>How will teams adapt their defensive strategies?</li>\n                </ul>\n                \n                <p>As the season unfolds, expect more 8-second violations, but also adaptations that make the Premier League even more thrilling.</p>\n                \n                <p>In related news, the 2025/26 season features other changes like stricter offside calls and captain-only referee interactions, all aimed at modernizing the league. For goalkeepers, the message is clear: <strong>Time is no longer on your side.</strong></p>\n                \n                <div class=\"key-points\">\n                    <h3>Quick Summary:</h3>\n                    <ul>\n                        <li>Martin Dubravka became the first goalkeeper penalized under the new 8-second rule</li>\n                        <li>The incident occurred in Burnley's 3-0 loss to Tottenham on August 16, 2025</li>\n                        <li>New rule awards a corner kick instead of indirect free kick for violations</li>\n                        <li>Referees now provide visual countdown at 5 seconds</li>\n                        <li>Rule aims to reduce time-wasting and speed up play</li>\n                    </ul>\n                </div>\n                \n                <p><em>Stay tuned for more updates on Premier League rule changes and their on-pitch effects.

Manchester City continues to set the standard with their possession-based system and squad depth, while Arsenal's young core looks to build upon recent progress with strategic additions and tactical maturity. Liverpool's transition under their management structure presents intriguing questions about their ability to compete at the highest level, while Chelsea's significant investment in young talent suggests a long-term vision that could yield immediate dividends.</p>\n                            \n                            <p>The title race isn't limited to traditional powerhouses, as Newcastle United's financial backing and Brighton's progressive approach demonstrate that innovation and smart recruitment can challenge established hierarchies. Each contender faces unique challenges: City must maintain motivation after recent success, Arsenal needs to prove their consistency across a full campaign, and Liverpool requires tactical adaptation to maximize their squad's potential. These dynamics create multiple compelling narratives that will unfold across 38 matchweeks of intense competition.</p>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                        <div class=\"season-section\">\n                            <h3><i class=\"fas fa-futbol\"></i> Key Storylines to Follow</h3>\n                            <p>Several overarching themes will define the 2024/25 season beyond simple league positions. The integration of young talents into established systems represents a crucial development, as clubs balance immediate success with long-term planning. Academy graduates and young signings will face the pressure of Premier League expectations while adapting to increased physical and tactical demands that separate top-flight football from other competitions.</p>\n                            \n                            <p>Managerial philosophies continue evolving as coaches adapt to modern football's demands, incorporating data analysis, sports science, and psychological factors into their strategic planning. The impact of VAR decisions, fixture congestion from European competitions, and injury management will significantly influence final standings. Additionally, the growing influence of international football on domestic performance creates scheduling challenges that test squad depth and rotation strategies across all clubs competing in multiple competitions.</p>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                        <div class=\"season-section\">\n                            <h3><i class=\"fas fa-star\"></i> Players to Watch</h3>\n                            <p>This season showcases an exceptional array of talent across all positions, from established superstars looking to cement their legacies to emerging prospects ready to announce themselves on football's biggest stage. Veteran players entering potential final seasons with their clubs carry extra motivation to deliver memorable campaigns, while newcomers to the Premier League face the challenge of adapting to English football's unique demands and expectations.</p>\n                            \n                            <p>The goalkeeper position features fascinating battles between experience and innovation, as shot-stoppers blend traditional skills with modern distribution requirements. Defensive partnerships will determine title challenges and relegation battles alike, while midfield creativity and work rate remain crucial for transitional play and tactical flexibility. Forward lines across the league combine pace, power, and technical ability in ways that promise spectacular entertainment and decisive moments throughout the campaign.</p>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                        <div class=\"season-section\">\n                            <h3><i class=\"fas fa-calendar-alt\"></i> Crucial Fixtures & Periods</h3>\n                            <p>The Premier League calendar presents several pivotal moments that could determine final standings and individual achievements. Early season fixtures set psychological precedents and confidence levels that influence subsequent performances, while the traditional Christmas period tests squad depth and rotation policies under intense scheduling pressure. International breaks disrupt domestic rhythm but provide recovery opportunities for key players carrying minor injuries or fatigue.</p>\n                            \n                            <p>The final stretch of the season typically produces the most dramatic moments, as relegation battles intensify and title races reach climactic conclusions. Weather conditions, pitch quality, and travel demands create additional variables that savvy managers must navigate while maintaining competitive standards. Derby matches and traditional rivalries add emotional intensity that can override form guides and tactical preparations, creating unpredictable results that reshape league standings when least expected.</p>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </section>\n    </main>\n\n\n    <!-- Footer -->\n    <footer class=\"site-footer\">\n        <div class=\"footer\" include=\"./footer.html\"></div>\n    </footer>\n\n    <script src=\"./index.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"./enhanced-homepage-v2.js\"></script>\n    <!-- Article popups removed for better user experience -->\n    <script type=\"module\">\n        // Initialize push notifications on page load\n        import PushNotificationService from './push-notification-service.js';\n        \n        let notificationService;\n        let notificationPromptShown = false;\n        \n        // Initialize after a short delay\n        setTimeout(async () => {\n            try {\n                notificationService = new PushNotificationService();\n                \n                // Notification prompt disabled for better user experience\n                // Users can enable notifications manually if desired\n                // setTimeout(() => {\n                //     showNotificationPrompt();\n                // }, 10000);\n                \n            } catch (error) {\n                console.error('Failed to initialize push notifications:', error);\n            }\n        }, 2000);\n        \n        function showNotificationPrompt() {\n            // Don't show if already shown this session or notifications already enabled\n            if (notificationPromptShown || \n                !notificationService?.isSupported || \n                notificationService?.isPermissionGranted ||\n                localStorage.getItem('notification-prompt-dismissed') === 'true') {\n                return;\n            }\n            \n            notificationPromptShown = true;\n            \n            // Create notification prompt\n            const promptDiv = document.createElement('div');\n            promptDiv.innerHTML = `\n                <div style=\"\n                    position: fixed;\n                    bottom: 20px;\n                    right: 20px;\n                    background: #37003c;\n                    color: white;\n                    padding: 20px;\n                    border-radius: 12px;\n                    box-shadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);\n                    max-width: 350px;\n                    z-index: 10000;\n                    font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, sans-serif;\n                    animation: slideInFromRight 0.3s ease-out;\n                \">\n                    <div style=\"display: flex;
