# Stripe Payment Processing - Fixed!

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Problem
The Stripe payment processing was failing because:
1. ❌ The Netlify function was in the wrong directory
2. ❌ Missing Stripe dependency in `package.json`
3. ❌ No `netlify.toml` configuration
4. ❌ Missing environment variable setup

### Solution
All issues have been fixed:
1. ✅ Moved `create-checkout-session.js` to `netlify/functions/`
2. ✅ Added Stripe package to `netlify/functions/package.json`
3. ✅ Created proper `netlify.toml` configuration
4. ✅ Documented environment variable requirements

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Commit and Push Changes

```bash
git add netlify/ netlify.toml
git commit -m "Fix Stripe payment processing

- Move checkout function to netlify/functions/
- Add Stripe dependency to package.json
- Configure netlify.toml for proper function routing
- Update environment variable documentation"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables in Netlify

1. **Go to your Netlify dashboard** → Your site → Site configuration → Environment variables

2. **Add the following variable:**

   **Required:**
   - **Key:** `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
   - **Value:** Your Stripe secret key (starts with `sk_live_` or `sk_test_`)
   - **Scopes:** All (Production, Deploy Previews, Branch deploys)

3. **Click "Save"**

## 📝 How to Get Your Stripe Secret Key

### For Testing (Recommended First)

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)
2. Click **"Developers"** in the left sidebar
3. Click **"API keys"**
4. Under **"Standard keys"** section:
   - Copy the **"Secret key"** (starts with `sk_test_...`)
   - This is for TEST MODE (no real money charged)

### For Production (Live Payments)

1. In Stripe Dashboard, toggle from **"Test mode"** to **"Live mode"** (switch at top right)
2. Go to **Developers** → **API keys**
3. Copy the **"Secret key"** (starts with `sk_live_...`)
4. **IMPORTANT:** Keep this key secure! Never commit it to GitHub.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Payment button says "Processing..." forever

**Cause:** Netlify function not deployed or environment variable missing

**Solution:**
1. Check Netlify deploy logs for errors
2. Verify `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is set in Netlify
3. Check browser console (F12) for error messages

### Error: "Failed to create checkout session"

**Cause:** Invalid Stripe secret key or price ID

**Solution:**
1. Verify your secret key starts with `sk_test_` or `sk_live_`
2. Check that price IDs in `membership.html` match your Stripe products
3. View Netlify function logs for detailed error

### Redirected to Stripe but payment fails

**Cause:** Price IDs don't match actual Stripe products

**Solution:**
1. Go to Stripe Dashboard → Products
2. Copy the Price IDs (start with `price_`)
3. Update in `membership.html` lines 284 and 301:
   ```javascript
   onclick="selectPlan('starter', 'price_YOUR_ACTUAL_ID')"
   onclick="selectPlan('pro', 'price_YOUR_ACTUAL_ID')"
   ```

### "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" error

**Cause:** CORS issue (already fixed in function)

**Solution:** The function includes proper CORS headers. If still seeing this:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Redeploy on Netlify
3. Check function code has proper headers (already included)
