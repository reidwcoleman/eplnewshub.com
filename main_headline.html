<h1> class="headlinelink">City's Rodri Out For Season With ACL Injury</h1>
</a>
<p>Manchester City’s Premier League campaign has been dealt a massive setback as their influential midfielder, Rodri, has been ruled out for the remainder of the 2024-2025 season due to an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. The injury occurred during City’s 2-2 draw with Arsenal on September 22, 2024, when Rodri went down in visible pain, clutching his knee. Subsequent tests confirmed the worst: a complete tear of his ACL, an injury that typically requires months of rehabilitation and recovery.</p>
