<h1 class="headlinelink">Paul Pogba's Doping Ban Reduced To 18 Months</h1>
</a>
<p>French football star Paul Pogba is on the verge of making a much-anticipated return to football after a rollercoaster 18 months marked by injury setbacks, a high-profile doping suspension, and personal controversies. After successfully appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), Pogba saw his initial four-year doping ban reduced to 18 months, paving the way for his return to competitive action in March 2025. This decision, while granting him an opportunity to restore his career, also ends what the 31-year-old has described as one of the most difficult chapters of his life.</p>
