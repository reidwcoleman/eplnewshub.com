<p>For over a decade, Mohamed Salah has been the face of Egyptian football, achieving legendary status both at home and abroad. As Salah enters the twilight of his career, Egypt is beginning to look to the next generation for someone who can carry the torch. That search may well be over, as a new star has emerged: Omar Marmoush. With his blistering pace, lethal finishing, and dynamic playmaking abilities, Marmoush is being heralded as Egypt’s next big hope. At just 25, the Eintracht Frankfurt forward is positioning himself as the natural successor to Salah, both for his club and the national team.</p>
