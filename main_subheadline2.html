<h1 class="headlinelink">Manchester United's Worst Team In Years</h1>
</a>
<p>Ruben Amorim said that his side may be the “Worst Team” in Manchester United's history after Man United's 3-1 loss to Brighton, who currently sit in 9th place in the EPL table with 34 points. Ruben Amorim and Man United, however, sit in 13th place for the season. “Everyone here is underperforming,” said Amorim after the loss. He is not wrong because a 13th-place finish would be the side's lowest finish in their history, and ever since Sir Alex Ferguson left the team, it has been all downhill from there.</p>
