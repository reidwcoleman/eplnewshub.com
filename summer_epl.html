            <h1>Latest EPL Transfers: Summer 2024</h1>
            <p>As the summer transfer window heats up, Premier League clubs have been busy reshaping their squads for the upcoming season. Here’s a rundown of the most significant moves so far:</p>

            <h2>Major Transfers In</h2>
            <h3>Chelsea</h3>
            <p>Bolstered their squad by signing Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall from Leicester City for £35.4 million and Omari Kellyman from Aston Villa for £22.5 million. Additionally, they have brought in Tosin Adarabioyo on a free transfer from Fulham and Renato Veiga from Basel for £14 million.</p>

            <h3>Manchester United</h3>
            <p>Made significant additions, including the acquisition of Leny Yoro from Lille for £58.9 million and Joshua Zirkzee from Bologna for €42.5 million. These signings reflect their intent to challenge for the title this season.</p>

            <h3>Liverpool</h3>
            <p>Focusing on departures rather than arrivals, they released several players, including Joel Matip and Thiago Alcantara, who retired from professional football. However, they are expected to make strategic additions as the window progresses.</p>

            <h3>Manchester City</h3>
            <p>Signed Savio from Troyes for £33.7 million but have seen the exits of academy graduates Liam Delap to Ipswich for £20 million and Taylor Harwood-Bellis to Southampton for the same fee.</p>

            <h3>Arsenal</h3>
            <p>Relatively conservative, with their most notable activity being the sale of Thomas Partey to Juventus for £40 million. They are expected to reinforce their squad in the coming weeks.</p>

            <h2>Significant Departures</h2>
            <h3>Everton</h3>
            <p>Sold Amadou Onana to Aston Villa for £59 million and Ben Godfrey to Atalanta for £12 million. The Toffees have also brought in Iliman Ndiaye from Marseille for €18 million to strengthen their attack.</p>

            <h3>Fulham</h3>
            <p>Saw key player Joao Palhinha move to Bayern Munich for €50 million. They also lost Bobby De Cordova-Reid to Leicester City on a free transfer, highlighting a significant reshuffle in their squad.</p>

            <h3>Leicester City</h3>
            <p>Active in both directions, with Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall moving to Chelsea for £30 million. They brought in Abdul Fatawu from Sporting CP for £17 million and Bobby De Cordova-Reid on a free transfer from Fulham.</p>

            <h3>Crystal Palace</h3>
            <p>Made a notable sale of Michael Olise to Bayern Munich for £50.8 million and acquired Chadi Riad from Real Betis for £15 million and Daichi Kamada from Lazio on a free transfer.</p>

            <h3>Bournemouth</h3>
            <p>Added Luis Sinisterra from Leeds for €23.4 million and Enes Unal from Getafe for €16.5 million. These signings indicate their ambition to solidify their Premier League status.</p>

            <p>This summer's transfer activities illustrate the dynamic nature of the Premier League as clubs aim to optimize their rosters for the 2024/2025 season. With the window still open, more high-profile moves are expected in the coming weeks.</p>
