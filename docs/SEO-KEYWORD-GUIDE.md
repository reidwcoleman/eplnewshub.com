# SEO Keyword Optimization Guide for EPL News Hub

## Core Principle
Keywords that appear in the article body MUST also appear in:
1. **Title tag** (`<title>`)
2. **H1 heading** 
3. **Meta description**
4. **Meta keywords**

## Keyword Extraction Process

### Step 1: Identify Primary Keywords from Body
Look for these elements in your article:
- **Specific numbers/stats** (e.g., "95th-minute", "188th goal", "four consecutive wins")
- **Location/venue** (e.g., "Turf Moor", "Etihad Stadium", "Old Trafford")
- **Key achievements** (e.g., "perfect start", "unbeaten streak", "record transfer")
- **Names and roles** (e.g., "Arne Slot", "Mohamed Salah penalty")
- **Specific timeframes** (e.g., "2025/26 season", "stoppage-time", "deadline day")

### Step 2: Title Optimization Formula
```
[Team vs Team]: [Player/Key Event] [Specific Time/Number] at [Venue] - [Achievement/Streak] | [Context]
```

**Example:**
```html
<title>Liverpool vs Burnley: Salah 95th-Minute Penalty at Turf Moor - Four Consecutive Wins | Match Report 2025/26</title>
```

### Step 3: H1 Optimization Formula
Should be slightly longer than title and include more keywords:
```
[Team vs Team]: [Player]'s [Specific Time] [Type of Goal/Event] at [Venue] [Achieves/Seals/Extends] [Streak/Record]
```

**Example:**
```html
<h1>Liverpool vs Burnley: Salah's 95th-Minute Stoppage-Time Penalty at Turf Moor Seals Four Consecutive Wins</h1>
```

### Step 4: Meta Description Formula
160 characters max, front-load with keywords:
```
[Team vs Team]: [Player] [specific action with time]. [Team] [achievement]. [Additional stat/context]. [Call to action].
```

**Example:**
```html
<meta name="description" content="Liverpool vs Burnley: Salah's 95th-minute stoppage-time penalty at Turf Moor seals 1-0 win. Reds maintain perfect start with four consecutive wins. Match report & analysis.">
```

## Quality Control Checklist

Before publishing any article, verify:

1. **Title includes:**
   - [ ] Teams/players mentioned in body
   - [ ] Specific numbers from body (minute, fee, streak)
   - [ ] Venue if mentioned
   - [ ] Current season/year

2. **H1 includes:**
   - [ ] All keywords from title
   - [ ] At least one additional specific detail from body
   - [ ] Natural reading flow

3. **Meta description includes:**
   - [ ] Primary keywords from first paragraph
   - [ ] At least one statistic from body
   - [ ] Under 160 characters
   - [ ] Call to action or context

4. **Consistency check:**
   - [ ] Same facts/numbers in title, H1, meta, and body
   - [ ] No contradictions between elements
   - [ ] Keywords appear naturally in body

## Tools for Validation

1. **Keyword density:** Ensure primary keywords appear 2-3% in body
2. **Length limits:**
   - Title: 50-60 characters ideal, max 70
   - Meta description: 150-160 characters
   - H1: Can be longer than title but concise

3. **Front-loading:** Most important keywords should appear first

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Generic titles:** "Liverpool Wins Against Burnley"
2. **Missing specifics:** Using "late goal" instead of "95th-minute"
3. **Keyword stuffing:** Repeating same keyword unnaturally
4. **Inconsistent facts:** Different times/scores in title vs body
5. **Ignoring venue:** Not mentioning stadium when it's significant
6. **Vague descriptions:** "Great performance" instead of specific stats

## Monthly Review Process

1. Audit top 10 articles for keyword alignment
2. Update templates based on best performers
3. Check Google Search Console for keyword opportunities
4. Adjust formula based on ranking improvements

**Remember:** If a keyword is important enough to mention multiple times in your article body, it MUST appear in your title, H1, and meta description.
