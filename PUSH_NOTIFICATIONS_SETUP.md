## üîß Configuration

### VAPID Keys (for Web Push)
You need to generate VAPID keys for web push notifications:

```bash
# Install web-push CLI globally
npm install -g web-push

# Generate VAPID keys
web-push generate-vapid-keys
```

Update these files with your keys:
- `push-notification-service.js` - Update `vapidPublicKey`
- `push-notification-server.js` - Update `vapidKeys`

### Firebase Setup (for Mobile)
For production mobile push notifications, you'll need Firebase:

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a new project
3. Add Android/iOS apps
4. Download configuration files:
   - `google-services.json` for Android
   - `GoogleService-Info.plist` for iOS
5. Update `push-notification-server.js` with Firebase credentials

- [ ] Use HTTPS for web push notifications
- [ ] Implement proper user authentication
- [ ] Add rate limiting to prevent spam

/push-notification-manager.html   # Management interface
/sw.js                            # Service worker (already had push support)
/capacitor.config.json            # Updated with push notification config
/server.js                        # Updated with push notification routes
