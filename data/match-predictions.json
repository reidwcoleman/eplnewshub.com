      "winner": "away",
      "confidence": 65,
      "analysis": "Aston Villa's recent form has been inconsistent, while Arsenal has been solid on the road. Arsenal's high-intensity press and quick transitions will test Villa's defense, and their attacking firepower should prove too much. Villa's best chance will be to catch Arsenal on the counter, but the visitors' quality should shine through.",

      "confidence": 60,
      "analysis": "Brentford has been tough to beat at home, and their direct style of play often causes problems for bigger teams. Chelsea has struggled for consistency, and their defense has been vulnerable to set pieces and quick breaks. A tight, low-scoring draw seems likely, with both teams canceling each other out.",

      "confidence": 70,
      "analysis": "Everton's home form has been decent, and they've shown an ability to grind out results against mid-table teams. Palace has struggled on the road, and their defense has been leaky at times. Everton's physicality and set piece threat should give them an edge, and they can exploit Palace's weaknesses to claim a narrow win.",

      "analysis": "Leeds has been porous at the back, and their high-intensity press can leave them exposed to quick counter-attacks. Manchester United has the pace and quality to exploit this, and their attacking trio should cause Leeds problems all game. United's superior firepower and defensive solidity should give them a comfortable win.",
