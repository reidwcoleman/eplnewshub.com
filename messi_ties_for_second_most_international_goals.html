    <h1>Lionel Messi Ties with Ali Daei for Second Most International Goals</h1>
    <p>Lionel Messi, the legendary Argentine footballer, has recently achieved another milestone in his illustrious career by tying with Iran's Ali Daei for the second-most international goals in men's football. As of June 2024, Messi has scored 109 international goals, equaling Daei's long-standing record.

    <h2>A Historic Achievement</h2>
    <p>Messi's journey to this achievement has been nothing short of spectacular. The seven-time Ballon d'Or winner reached this milestone during Argentina's pre-Copa America friendly matches. Known for his consistent performance, Messi has been a pivotal figure for the national team since his debut in 2005. His goal-scoring prowess has seen him net crucial goals in World Cup qualifiers, Copa America tournaments, and various international friendlies.

    <h2>Messi's International Career in Numbers</h2>
    <p>Messi's 109 international goals have come from 181 appearances for Argentina. His goals are spread across different competitions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Friendlies: 48 goals</li>
        <li>World Cup qualifiers: 28 goals</li>
        <li>Copa America: 13 goals</li>
        <li>World Cup: 13 goals</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Additionally, Messi has recorded nine international hat-tricks, which places him second in the list of players with the most hat-tricks in international football, just behind Cristiano Ronaldo, who has ten.

    <h2>Comparisons with Other Legends</h2>
    <p>Cristiano Ronaldo remains the all-time leading scorer in men's international football with 130 goals. Messi's recent feat puts him in the elite company of Ronaldo and Daei as the only men to surpass the century mark in international goals. Daei, who scored his 109 goals in 148 appearances between 1993 and 2006, was the record-holder until Ronaldo and now Messi surpassed his tally.

    <h2>Future Prospects</h2>
    <p>Despite being 36 years old, Messi shows no signs of slowing down. With the Copa America and potential participation in the 2026 World Cup on the horizon, Messi has opportunities to add to his goal tally and perhaps even challenge Ronaldo's record. Messi's dedication and performance suggest that he could continue to be a key player for Argentina, contributing significantly to their international success.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Lionel Messi's achievement of tying with Ali Daei for the second most international goals underscores his incredible talent and longevity in international football. As he continues to play at the highest level, football fans around the world will eagerly watch to see if he can surpass Ronaldo's record and solidify his place as the greatest international goal-scorer of all time.</br>
