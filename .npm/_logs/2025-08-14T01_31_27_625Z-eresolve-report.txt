# npm resolution error report

While resolving: eplnewshub@1.0.0
Found: @capacitor/core@5.7.8
node_modules/@capacitor/core
  @capacitor/core@"^5.7.8" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer @capacitor/core@">=7.0.0" from @capacitor/push-notifications@7.0.2
node_modules/@capacitor/push-notifications
  @capacitor/push-notifications@"*" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
