            <h3>Defenders:</h3>
            <p><strong>Trent Alexander-Arnold (£7.0m)</strong> - Despite a challenging season, Alexander-Arnold remains one of the best attacking defenders in FPL. His ability to create chances and take set pieces ensures he continues to be a popular pick [[❞]](https://www.premierleague.com/news/4056966).</p>
            <p><strong>Fabian Schar (£5.5m)</strong> - Schar’s attacking returns and solid defensive performances make him a good option for those looking for a dependable defender at a reasonable price [[❞]](https://www.fantasyfootballscout.co.uk/2024/07/15/fpl-2024-25-price-reveals-mondays-live-updates/).</p>

            <h3>Goalkeepers:</h3>
            <p><strong>David Raya (£5.5m)</strong> - Raya is likely to be one of the top-priced goalkeepers this season. His consistent performances and ability to keep clean sheets make him a strong choice for FPL managers [[❞]](https://www.fantasyfootballscout.co.uk/2024/07/15/fpl-2024-25-price-reveals-mondays-live-updates/).</p>

            <h2>Strategies for Team Selection</h2>
            <p><strong>Balancing Star Power with Value Picks:</strong> While it’s tempting to load up on superstars like Haaland and Salah, balancing your team with mid-priced and value picks is crucial. Players like Isak and Eze offer good returns at more manageable prices.</p>
            <p><strong>Favorable Fixtures:</strong> Early season fixtures are a key consideration. Newcastle, for instance, has a favorable opening run, making their players particularly attractive. Targeting teams with easier fixtures can give you a strong start.</p>
            <p><strong>Avoiding Overpriced Players:</strong> Be cautious with players who might be overpriced relative to their expected performance. For instance, while Haaland’s price is justified, fitting him in means making sacrifices elsewhere.</p>
