With the introduction of the expanded FIFA Club World Cup taking center stage from June 15 to July 13 in the United States, many top European clubs had their preseason schedules adjusted or curtailed to accommodate the tournament. This competitive event, featuring 32 teams from around the world, served as intense preparation for participants, while non-participants engaged in traditional friendly tours and series. Notable among these were the Premier League Summer Series and various club-specific preseason matches. Below, we break down the key events, fixtures, and results, focusing on major leagues and tours.\nFIFA Club World Cup 2025: The Summer's Premier Competition\nThe FIFA Club World Cup 2025 marked a significant expansion from its previous format, hosting 32 clubs across six confederations in 12 U.S. venues. Running from June 15 to July 13, it provided high-stakes matches that doubled as preseason tune-ups for many European giants like Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Chelsea, and Paris Saint-Germain. Chelsea emerged as champions, defeating Paris Saint-Germain 3-0 in the final at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford. The tournament's knockout stage delivered thrilling encounters, with key results including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStageDateMatchResultVenueFinalJuly 13Chelsea vs Paris Saint-Germain3-0MetLife Stadium, East RutherfordSemifinalsJuly 8Fluminense vs Chelsea0-2(Not specified)SemifinalsJuly 9Paris Saint-Germain vs Bayern Munich1-0(Not specified)Quarterfinals (example)July 4Real Madrid vs Al-Hilal2-1 (Real Madrid eliminated earlier rounds in some reports)Various U.S. stadiums\nChelsea's victory made them the inaugural winners under the new format, with standout performances from players like Enzo Fernández and Cole Palmer. For clubs involved, this tournament replaced much of their typical preseason, leading to shorter friendly schedules afterward.\nPremier League Summer Series 2025\nThe Premier League Summer Series returned for its third edition, featuring four clubs— AFC Bournemouth, Everton, Manchester United, and West Ham United—playing in a round-robin format across three U.S. venues from July 26 to August 3. This series aimed to build fan engagement in North America while allowing teams to fine-tune tactics. Manchester United dominated, remaining unbeaten with two wins and a draw to claim the title with seven points.\nHere are the fixtures and results:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDateMatchResultVenueJuly 26Everton vs AFC Bournemouth1-2MetLife Stadium, East Rutherford, NJJuly 26Manchester United vs West Ham United3-1MetLife Stadium, East Rutherford, NJJuly 30West Ham United vs Everton2-1Soldier Field, Chicago, ILJuly 30Manchester United vs AFC Bournemouth2-0Soldier Field, Chicago, ILAugust 3AFC Bournemouth vs West Ham United1-1Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Atlanta, GAAugust 3Manchester United vs Everton2-2Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Atlanta, GA\nFinal Standings:\n\nManchester United (7 points)\nWest Ham United (4 points)\nAFC Bournemouth (4 points)\nEverton (1 point)\n\nHighlights included Marcus Rashford's brace for United against West Ham and a late equalizer in their draw with Everton.\nOther Notable Preseason Games and Tours\nWith many top clubs recovering from the Club World Cup, preseason friendlies were more subdued in 2025. Here's a roundup by league, focusing on key results:\nPremier League Clubs\nBeyond the Summer Series, Premier League teams played additional friendlies globally. Arsenal's tour in Asia stood out, with mixed results:\n\nJuly 23: Arsenal 1-0 AC Milan (Singapore)\nJuly 27: Arsenal 3-2 Newcastle United (Singapore)\nJuly 31: Arsenal 0-1 Tottenham Hotspur (Hong Kong)\nAugust 6: Arsenal 2-3 Villarreal (Spain)\nAugust 9: Arsenal 3-0 Athletic Bilbao (Spain)\n\nOther notable results:\n\nAugust 10: Chelsea 4-1 AC Milan (London)\nCrystal Palace 2-2 Liverpool (3-2 on penalties, FA Community Shield)\nBrighton 1-0 Southampton (behind closed doors)\n\nAston Villa toured the U.S. separately:\n\nJuly 30: St. Louis City SC 1-2 Aston Villa (St. Louis, MO)\nAugust 2: Nashville SC 0-3 Aston Villa (Nashville, TN)\n\nClubs like Manchester City and Chelsea, fresh from the Club World Cup, opted for limited games to prioritize recovery.\nLa Liga Clubs\nLa Liga teams had abbreviated preseasons due to Club World Cup commitments. Real Madrid, eliminated in the quarterfinals, played just one friendly:\n\nAugust 12: Real Madrid 4-0 WSG Swarovski Tirol (Austria)\n\nBarcelona focused on recovery, with a single warmup:\n\nAugust 9: Barcelona 2-1 Mallorca (Spain)\n\nTheir league opener was just days after, on August 16.\nSerie A Clubs\nSerie A clubs ramped up in late July, with Juventus starting training on July 24. Key friendlies included:\n\nAugust 12: Internazionale 2-0 Monza (Italy)\nAugust 16: Olympiacos 1-3 Internazionale (Italy)\nAugust 16: Juventus 2-2 Atalanta (Italy)\n\nAC Milan played several, including losses to Chelsea and Arsenal.\nBundesliga Clubs\nGerman teams held numerous friendlies in July and August. Bayern Munich, after a Club World Cup semifinal exit, played:\n\nAugust 12: Bayern Munich 3-1 Grasshoppers (Switzerland)\n\nOther clubs like Borussia Dortmund toured Asia, with results like a 4-0 win over a Japanese select side. Preseason standouts included young talents like Jobe Bellingham.\nMLS and Other Leagues\nMLS preseason occurred in January-February 2025, well before summer, with teams like Houston Dynamo drawing multiple games (e.g., 1-1 vs Cincinnati, 3-3 vs New England). Summer saw limited friendlies, including the Aston Villa tour mentioned above.\nConclusion\nThe summer of 2025 redefined soccer's offseason, with the FIFA Club World Cup adding a competitive edge to what is typically a period of low-stakes preparation. While tours like the Premier League Summer Series provided entertainment for U.S. fans, the overall number of preseason games was reduced due to player welfare concerns post-tournament. As leagues kick off—Premier League on August 15, La Liga on August 16, and others soon after—clubs will build on these experiences for what promises to be an exciting 2025-26 season."
