# FPL AI Assistant Setup Guide

## Getting Real AI Working (Like ChatGPT)

Your FPL AI Assistant now uses **real AI models** via serverless functions. Here's how to set it up:

## Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Option 1: Free Groq API (Recommended - Fastest)

1. **Get a FREE Groq API key** (no credit card required):
   - Visit: https://console.groq.com/keys
   - Sign up with Google/GitHub
   - Click "Create API Key"
   - Copy your key (starts with `gsk_...`)

2. **Add to Netlify Environment Variables**:
   - Go to your Netlify dashboard
   - Navigate to: Site settings â†’ Environment variables
   - Add new variable:
     - **Key**: `GROQ_API_KEY`
     - **Value**: Your API key from step 1
   - Save and redeploy

3. **That's it!** Your AI assistant now uses Llama 3.3 70B (GPT-4 quality)

### Option 2: Use Free OpenRouter (No API Key Needed)

The assistant automatically falls back to OpenRouter's free Gemini 2.0 model if Groq is not configured. This works out of the box with no setup!

## How It Works

```
User Message â†’ Netlify Function â†’ AI API â†’ ChatGPT-like Response
                     â†“ (if API fails)
                 Enhanced Offline Mode
```

## API Limits (Free Tier)

### Groq (Recommended)
- **Requests**: 30 requests/minute
- **Daily**: 14,400 requests/day
- **More than enough** for typical usage
- **No credit card** required

### OpenRouter
- **Requests**: 200/day (free tier)
- **Automatic fallback** - no setup needed

## Troubleshooting

**AI not working?**
1. Check Netlify environment variables are set
2. Redeploy your site after adding variables
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Offline mode always works as fallback

**Want faster responses?**
- Use Groq API (Option 1 above)
- Responses are typically under 1 second

**Want better quality?**
- Groq's Llama 3.3 70B is comparable to GPT-4
- OpenRouter's Gemini 2.0 is also excellent

## Privacy & Security

âœ… API keys stored securely in Netlify (server-side)
âœ… Never exposed to users
âœ… All requests proxied through your serverless function
âœ… CORS protection enabled

## Cost

**$0.00** - Everything is FREE:
- âœ… Groq API - Free tier
- âœ… OpenRouter - Free tier
- âœ… Netlify Functions - Free tier (125k/month)

## Going to Production

Current setup handles:
- 1000s of daily users
- Automatic fallbacks
- Rate limiting protection
- Error handling

For massive scale (100k+ users/day):
- Consider paid Groq tier ($$$0.10 per 1M tokens)
- Still cheaper than OpenAI
- Or add more free fallback services
